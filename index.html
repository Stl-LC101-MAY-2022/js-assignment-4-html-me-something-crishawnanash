            <p id = "testP" class = "funParagraph">The first fun fact about me is that I have a collection of stuffed animals. Total I have more than 50 stuffed animals that were given to me as gifts.</p>
            <p>The next fun fact about me is that I have a twin sister. I call her Taisha Washnash. That name comes from when we ran track in high school and they completely butchered her name when they were trying to pronouce it. My sister and I are alike in many ways but we are also very different She is a lot quieter than me and I can be extremely outspoken especially when it comes to somehting that I really care about.  </p>
